- Project is done as an assignment under Hackwagon Acadamy's DS102 Data Analytics with Python class
- Aim: To prepare a prediction model to detect loan defaulters from the LendingClub
- Analysis is done using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models: 
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Decision Tree Classifier 
- Performance of machine learning models are measured using confusion matrices, accuracy and precision scores
- More details can be found in jupyter notebook file, DS102_LendingClub - Assignment.ipynb
